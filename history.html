                        The Lenovo T60 is a terminal that runs Windows 7 Pro and remotes into a VDI VM that runs Windows 7, so that it can interface with the rest of the network (It's isolated.)<br/><br/>
                        Considering getting that JBOD running, I did the math and it can handle 26TB alltogether if I decided to run it in the lab for additional space.

                        <p class="text-small mt-2 font-weight-light">The Avaya / Nortel switch that was servicing my network experienced a failure which required immediate replacement to resume operations.</p>
                        <p class="text-small mt-2 font-weight-light">So, for the time being I replaced it with a TP-Link 24-port "Dumbswitch" to get things going again until I could replace it.</p>

                        <p class="text-small mt-2 font-weight-light">I made some poor decisions in regards to where to place the rack in relative positition to the house. For whatever reason, I thought it was a great idea to put the rack under the bathroom upstairs.</p>
                        <p class="text-small mt-2 font-weight-light">After rewiring most of the drops (Cat-5e Ethernet Keystones) throughout the house, I moved the rack to a more "dry location" and rewired it all up. (Alot neater this time =])</p>
                        <p class="text-small mt-2 font-weight-light">I also picked up a nice APC PDU that allows me to reboot server(s)/the switch remotely via a web interface as well as added power-filtering for equipment safety peace of mind.</p>

                        <p class="text-small mt-2 font-weight-light">After obtaining my Dell R410, I started to realize just how much money I was throwing at some "dream" I had and said screw it and continued to dump money into this project aimlessly.</p>
                        <p class="text-small mt-2 font-weight-light">I had a friend who worked for a local company who was selling an R310, and I thought it would be PERFECT for a network operations server (Routing, DNS, VPN, etc.) and I immediately added it to the lab.</p>
                        <p class="text-small mt-2 font-weight-light">Hell, the server even came with a free Avaya/Nortel switch! 48 ports and only 9 devices to attach to it! Overkill as hell, but why not!</p>

                        <p class="text-small mt-2 font-weight-light">Quickly, me and my father both realized that this "homelab" is going to absolutely guzzle power, and at the time it was on a circuit that had alot of other things on it.</p>
                        <p class="text-small mt-2 font-weight-light">That just <em>wouldn't work.</em> Together, he and I installed a new circuit into our electrical panel, giving the lab it's own breaker and electrical line.</p>
                        <p class="text-small mt-2 font-weight-light">We installed, into the existing electrical box that came with the rack, two GFCI outlets and a new pipe to contain the electrical wire, isolating it from the lower-voltage lines that went inside the rack.</p>

                        <p class="text-small mt-2 font-weight-light">Shortly after purchasing that rack, I had already ordered a Dell Poweredge R410 from a seller off eBay to start off with. My very first server!</p>

                        <p class="text-small mt-2 font-weight-light">I continued to run the older Dell Inspiron tower for core services like routing, DNS and VPN access below the R410.</p>
                        <p class="text-small mt-2 font-weight-light">I also added some rack-hardware like a keystone panel and a shelf for connecting to drops I had started to install throughout the house.</p>

                        <p class="text-small mt-2 font-weight-light">A friend of mine who worked in IT messaged me in regards to selling a full-height 43u rack. I had absolutely no idea what I'd do with it, but part of me said <em>do it.</em></p>

                        <p class="text-small mt-2 font-weight-light">We all start somewhere right? Well, this is where my story began...</p>
                        <p class="text-small mt-2 font-weight-light">It all began with a desktop tower, a Dell Inspiron 580 to be exact. It only had 8GB of RAM, 300GB of space, and an Intel i5 750. (Yes, I upgraded it.)</p>
                        <p class="text-small mt-2 font-weight-light">Not much to work with here, right? Well, I squeezed every possible resource out of that thing, running pfSense, piHole, OpenVPN, and a NextCloud VM all at once! It was hardly able to keep up with all of that!</p>
                        <p class="text-small mt-2 font-weight-light">This little dinky thing managed to run all of that, but it was struggling and I wanted <em>More! More space, more power, more everything!</em> So much potential, yet nowhere to utilize it!</p>
                        <p class="text-small mt-2 font-weight-light">That sparked something in me that has come to show me exactly what I'm capable of, running my very own homelab with more space than I'd ever need.</p>
